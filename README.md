# typed-error-handling-demo

This repository is created as a supporting material in the study in "Typed Error Handling inÂ Kotlin".

The approach explored in this repository includes:
- Exception based error handling
- Vanilla sealed class chaining
- Vanilla sealed class with early returns
- Arrow `Raise<E>` with context receivers
- Arrow with `either { }` builder
- Arrow vanilla `Either<L, R>` with flatMap chaining
